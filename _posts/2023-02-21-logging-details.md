## Logging - An explanation of the role of logging in observability and how it helps to provide a complete picture of an application's behavior
Logging is an essential component of observability, playing a crucial role in monitoring and diagnosing the behavior of complex systems. In this blog, we will explain the role of logging in observability and how it helps to provide a complete picture of an application's behavior. We will also provide a real-world example to illustrate the importance of logging in software engineering.

**Role of Logging in Observability**

Logging refers to the process of capturing and storing log data in a centralized location. Log data contains information about what's happening in a system and provides an insight into the behavior of the system. Logging is an essential tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes, and helps to ensure that systems are functioning correctly.
By capturing log data from various sources including application logs, system logs, network logs, and other data sources, logging provides a complete picture of an application's behavior. This information can be used to troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and improve the overall functioning of a system.
It is important to standardize the format and structure of log data to make it easier to search and analyze. Some of the commonly used log formats are JSON, XML, and plain text.

**Real-World Example**

Let's consider a real-world example of how logging can help to provide a complete picture of an application's behavior. Consider a large e-commerce website that receives a high volume of traffic. The website suddenly becomes slow, and users start complaining about long wait times.
In such a scenario, logging can help to quickly diagnose the issue. By analyzing the log data, the engineering team can determine that the slow response times are due to a spike in traffic, causing the database to become overwhelmed. By capturing log data in real-time, the engineering team can quickly identify the source of the problem and take appropriate action to resolve the issue.

**Conclusion**

Logging is an essential component of observability, providing a complete picture of an application's behavior. By capturing log data from various sources, logging helps to ensure that systems are functioning correctly and provides valuable insights for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes. The real-world example of a large e-commerce website demonstrates how logging can help to quickly diagnose and resolve issues, improving the overall functioning of a system.
