## An overview of the three main components of observability: logging, tracing, and metric collection.

Observability is the ability to monitor and diagnose the behavior of complex systems. It is a crucial aspect of software engineering and helps to ensure that systems are functioning correctly, troubleshoot issues, and provide meaningful insights for improvements. This blog will discuss the essential components of observability and what they are used for.
The three main components of observability are logging, tracing, and metric collection. Let's delve into each of these components in more detail.

## 1. Logging

Logging refers to the process of capturing and storing log data in a centralized location. Log data contains information about what's happening in a system and provides insight into the behavior of the system. It can be used for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes.
Log data can be captured from various sources, including application logs, system logs, network logs, and other data sources. It is important to standardize the format and structure of log data to make it easier to search and analyze. Some commonly used log formats are JSON, XML, and plain text.

## 2. Tracing

Tracing refers to the process of tracking the flow of requests and their related events as they move through a system. It provides a complete picture of the request journey, including how long it took for the request to be processed and where it failed. Tracing is an essential tool for debugging complex systems and provides deep visibility into system behavior.
Tracing is typically achieved by adding unique identifiers to requests as they enter a system and capturing relevant information as they move through the system. This information is then linked together to form a trace that can be analyzed to determine the root cause of a problem.

## 3. Metrics

Metric collection refers to the process of collecting and aggregating data that provides insight into the performance of a system. Metrics can be used to monitor system health, track performance over time, and detect performance degradation.
Some of the commonly used metrics include CPU usage, memory usage, network latency, and request response time. It is important to choose the right metrics that are relevant to the system being monitored and to collect them at a high frequency to ensure that performance degradation is detected early.
**Conclusion**

Observability is a crucial aspect of software engineering and is used to ensure that systems are functioning correctly and to diagnose issues when they occur. The three main components of observability are logging, tracing, and metric collection. Logging provides insight into what's happening in a system, tracing provides a complete picture of the request journey, and metric collection provides insight into system performance. By using these components together, organizations can ensure that their systems are functioning correctly and can quickly diagnose and resolve issues when they occur.
